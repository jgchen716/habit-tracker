### How much do you think you learned throughout the project? List at least two concrete examples.

This project was personally very valuable because I had the opportunity to go through the whole app "life cycle" myself. Rather than following instructions, I had to deliberately decide what functionality I wanted and how I would implement it. As for more tangible features, I learned how to 1) manage state with the `Stepper`, 2) allow date selection with the `UIDatePicker`, 3) get the current date with a `Date()` object, as well as 4) how to use closures with higher order functions like `filter` (used to implement search bar functionality).

### What class material do you review? List at least two concrete examples.
In my class project, I reviewed segues (`push` and `present modally`), navigation controllers, table view controllers, as well adding constraints.

### Do you plan to continue working on this project?
Yes, I do plan to continue working on my Habit Track app. Although I think all of the core functionality (adding/deleting habits, tracking days for each habit, searching, "rewarding" users when they've tracked a habit for several successive days, etc.), I would like to improve the UI/UX and allow the app to send reminders (either through Apple's Reminders app or via text message or push notifications).

### General Comments
I think this project was useful to get insight into iOS development. I've certainly realized how different working with UIKit is than web development, and how the debugging process is very different for Swift and XCode.
